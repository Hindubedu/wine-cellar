# 🍷 Kaer Morhen's Finest: A Witcher's Wine Cellar 🧪

## "Wind's howling... Time for a drink!" - Geralt of Rivia

Welcome to the most ambitious crossover between monster slaying and wine tasting! This project is a digital wine cellar management system, lovingly crafted for storing Witcher brews and keeping track of Yennefer's ever-growing collection of rare vintages.

## 🗡️ Features

- **Potion Tracking**: Keep your Thunderbolt and Swallow potions organized. No more mixing up your hangover cure with your combat enhancers!
- **Vintage Management**: Because Yennefer insists on knowing the exact year of her Toussaint red.
- **Gwent Card Pairing**: Recommend the perfect brew for your next Gwent tournament.
- **Roach-Proof Storage**: Our advanced algorithms ensure your storage solutions are immune to Roach's teleportation shenanigans.

## 🐺 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository faster than a Bruxa on a moonless night.
2. Run `dotnet restore` to gather ingredients (dependencies).
3. Brew your database with `dotnet ef database update`. Don't worry, it's less volatile than Shani's experiments.
4. Launch the application with `dotnet run`. It's easier than convincing Dandelion to stop singing.

## 🧙‍♀️ API Endpoints

- `POST /api/brews`: Add a new brew. Alchemy skills required.
- `GET /api/cellar`: View your collection. Try not to get too thirsty.
- `DELETE /api/empties`: Clean up after a wild night at the Passiflora.

## 🎮 Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core**: Because even Witchers need a robust backend.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Mapping relations more intricately than the politics of the Northern Kingdoms.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secured tighter than Phillipa Eilhart's schemes.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Documentation clearer than Triss Merigold's intentions.
- **Carter Modules**: Organizing code better than Vesemir organizes Witcher trainees.

## 🏰 Architecture

This project follows the School of the Wolf architecture:

- **Medallion Layer** (API): Vibrates in the presence of monsters and bad requests.
- **Signs Layer** (Services): Casts a protective barrier around our business logic.
- **Alchemy Layer** (Data Access): Brews up the perfect mix of data and storage.

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests with `dotnet test`. Remember, a Witcher always verifies their potions before drinking!

## 🎵 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! But remember:

1. Evil is evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. If I'm to choose between contributing and not contributing, I'd rather contribute.
2. Mistakes are like Drowners - best dealt with quickly and decisively.
3. Your pull requests will be tossed about by the winds of continuous integration like a boat on a storm. Steady as she goes!
